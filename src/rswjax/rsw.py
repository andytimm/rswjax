    Arguments:
        - df: Pandas dataframe
        - funs: functions to apply to each row of df.
        - losses: list of losses, each one of rsw.EqualityLoss, rsw.InequalityLoss, rsw.LeastSquaresLoss,

        - regularizer: One of rsw.ZeroRegularizer, rsw.EntropyRegularizer,

        - lam (optional): Regularization hyper-parameter (default=1).
        - kwargs (optional): additional arguments to be sent to solver. For example: verbose=False,
            maxiter=5000, rho=50, eps_rel=1e-5, eps_abs=1e-5.

        - w: Final sample weights.
